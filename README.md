#Develop With PassionÂ® - Windows Machine Setup

There are two separate documents for the setup process. One for if you have admin rights:

* [Setup for a machine that you are running with an admin account] (README_ADMIN.md)
* [Setup for a machine that you are running that you have to explicitly "Run as administrator"] (README_NON_ADMIN.md)
